    <string name="bio"> Hi, My name is Jessica.
        \n\n I love cat.
        \n\n The kind that is always sleep and when is wake up eat, jump, bit and definitely ignore you.
        \n\n Fun fact is that I have 3 cats and all of them ignore me.
        \n\n I don\'t like eat cat, raw cat? no,  grilled cat? no, smoked cat? no, poached cat? no, please.
        \n\n And sometimes I even feed stray cats.
        \n\n And even less sometimes I actually pet some cat.
        \n\n Once I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large cat with my hands. But no ate it.
        \n\n I\'ll be happy to teach you how yo have your own cats.
        \n You should ask someone else about how to feed them or how to clean their litter box, though. \n\n </string>
